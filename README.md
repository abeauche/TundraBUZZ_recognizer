GitHub Repository for Alex Beauchemin's ecology honours (B.Sc. Hons) research project with Team Shrub in the Faculty of Forestry at the University of British Columbia.

This repository contains the current TundraBUZZ recognizer model and scripts, as well as outputs. Scripts for this recognizer were adapted from code written by Charlotte Mittelstaedt and Ciara Norton, and recognizer was trained by Alex Beauchemin and Ciara Norton on data annotated by Alex Beauchemin.
